    1. Correctness and Relevance:
    - Compare the actual response against the expected response. 
    Determine the extent to which the actual response 
    captures the key elements and concepts of the expected response.
    - Assign higher scores to actual responses that accurately reflect 
    the core information of the expected response, even if only partial.
    2. Numerical Accuracy and Interpretation:
    - Pay particular attention to any  numerical values present 
    in the expected  response. Verify that these values are 
    correctly included in the actual  response and accurately 
    interpreted within the context.
    - Ensure that units of measurement, scales, and numerical 
    relationships are preserved and correctly conveyed.
    3. Allowance for Partial Information:
    - Do not heavily penalize the actual response for incompleteness 
    if it covers significant aspects of the expected response. 
    Prioritize the correctness of provided information over 
    total completeness.
    4. Handling of Extraneous Information:
    - While additional information not present in the expected response 
    should not  necessarily reduce score, 
    ensure that such additions do not introduce inaccuracies 
    or deviate from the context of the expected response.)"""

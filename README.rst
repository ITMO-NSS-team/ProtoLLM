Intro
#####

**Proto-LLM** is an open-source framework for fast protyping of LLM-based applications.


Proto LLM features
==================
- Rapid prototyping of information retrieval systems based on LLM using RAG:
Implementations of architectural patterns for interacting with different databases and web service interfaces;
Methods for optimising RAG pipelines to eliminate redundancy.

- Development and integration of applications with LLM with connection of external services and models through plugin system:
Integration with AutoML solutions for predictive tasks;
Providing structured output generation and validation;

- Implementation of ensemble methods and multi-agent approaches to improve the efficiency of LLMs:
Possibility of combining arbitrary LLMs into ensembles to improve generation quality, automatic selection of ensemble composition;
Work with model-agents and ensemble pipelines;

- Generation of complex synthetic data for further training and improvement of LLM:
Generating examples from existing models and data sets;
Evolutionary optimisation to increase the diversity of examples; Integration with Label Studio;

- Providing interoperability with various LLM providers:
Support for native models (GigaChat, YandexGPT, vsegpt, etc.).
Interaction with open-source models deployed locally.


Installation
============

- Package installer for Python **pip**

The simplest way to install ProtoLLM is using ``pip``:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install protollm

Modules with tools can be installed separately:

.. code-block::

  $ pip install protollm-worker

  $ pip install protollm-api

  $ pip install protollm-sdk


Project Structure
=================

The latest stable release of ProtoLLM is in the `master branch <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/ProtoLLM/tree/master>`__.

The repository includes the following directories:

* Package `protollm <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/ProtoLLM/tree/master/protollm>`__  contains the main modules. It is the *core* of the ProtoLLM framework;
* Package `protollm_tools <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/ProtoLLM/tree/master/protollm_tools>`__  contains side tools with specific dependensied;
* Package `examples <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/ProtoLLM/tree/master/examples>`__ includes several *how-to-use-cases* where you can start to discover how ProtoLLM works;
* All *unit and integration tests* can be observed in the `test <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/ProtoLLM/tree/master/test>`__ directory;
* The sources of the documentation are in the `docs <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/ProtoLLM/tree/master/docs>`__ directory.
